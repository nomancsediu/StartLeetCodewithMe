# StartLeetCodewithMe

A structured journey to master Data Structures & Algorithms through **pattern-wise** problem solving.

## 📅 My Plan

Starting from **22nd**, I will begin my LeetCode journey with a consistent daily routine:

* **🎯 Solve 3 problems every day**
* **🔍 Focus on one pattern per day**
* **📚 Prioritize understanding over memorizing**

## 🧩 Why Pattern-Based Learning?

Pattern-based learning helps you:

* Recognize problem types instantly
* Build strong intuition and logic
* Solve faster in interviews
* Reduce confusion about where to start

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a specific DSA pattern and includes:

* Problem links
* Clean solutions
* Short explanations and key ideas
* Time & space complexity

## 🎯 Goal

Stay consistent, improve steadily, and build a strong foundation in DSA through daily practice—one pattern at a time.

## 🌱 Follow the Journey

This repository documents my progress, learnings, mistakes, and improvements throughout this challenge.
